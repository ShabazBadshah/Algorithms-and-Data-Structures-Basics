# Top 50 Data Structure Knowledge Interview Questions

## 1. What is data structure

A data structure is a means to organize and manipulate data quickly and efficiently.

---

## 2. Differentiate between file and structure storage structures

File structure will save data into memory that is not within the system. Storage structure is memory within the system.

---

## 3. When is a binary search best applied

A binary search is best applied to a collection of already sorted data. Since the data is sorted, the search will take O(log n) time to find what is needed. __*Binary search can only be executed on a sorted collection.*__

---

## 4. What is a linked list

A linked list is data structure created with *Nodes*. A Node contains the data that it is storing and reference to the next Node in the list. Think of a linked list as a single-filed line, where you only know about the person who is infront of you. The structure just described is a single-linked list. A *Linked List* will always contain a *Head* reference which keeps track of the current Node that is being looked at and is used to traverse the list. The Head can be thought of as a person going through the line and picking individual people out.

## 5. How do you reference all the elements in a one-dimension array

Use a for loop and traverse from index 0 to len(list)-1 and perform operation(s) on each item in the array.

---

## 6. In what areas are data structures are applied

Anything that involves an algorithm, or when you need to organize data.

---

## 7. What is LIFO

Last-In-First-Out. A Stack data structure utilizes a LIFO approach, where the last item inserted into the Stack is the first item to be taken out. A LIFO structure is analogous to a stack of dishes. If you have a stack of dishes and need to take one off, you will take a dish off the top. If you need to add a dish to the stack of dishes, you will add it to the top.
