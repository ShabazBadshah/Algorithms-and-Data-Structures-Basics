## What is MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL Database, also commonly known as a Non-relational (hence NoSQL) database. MongoDB functions based on collections and documents and exposes a Javascript API that we can use to interact with the database.

MongoDB does not support schemas in contrast to its RDBMS alternatives. Data is instead stored in a format very similar to JSON (Javascript Object Notation) where fields can be added dynamically.
